            "I am writing regarding Ms. Chen, whom I have been following with increased "
            "frequency (every 3 months) due to an alarming pattern of accelerated dental caries.\n\n"
            "DENTAL HISTORY:\n"
            "- Prior to 2021: No caries in 10 years. Excellent oral hygiene.\n"
            "- 11/2021: 3 new cervical caries (#5, #12, #29). Restored.\n"
            "- 06/2022: 4 new cervical/root caries (#3, #14, #19, #30). Restored.\n"
            "- Total: 7 new caries in 8 months despite prescription fluoride toothpaste, "
            "Biotene rinse, and excellent compliance.\n\n"
            "All caries are at the CERVICAL (gumline) and ROOT SURFACE -- this is the classic "
            "pattern of XEROSTOMIA-INDUCED CARIES, not typical coronal caries. This pattern is "
            "highly associated with Sjogren's syndrome.\n\n"
            "PHYSICAL FINDINGS:\n"
            "- Severely dry oral mucosa despite Biotene and frequent water sipping\n"
            "- Bilateral parotid gland enlargement (progressive)\n"
            "- Fissured, dry tongue\n"
            "- Reduced saliva pooling (nearly absent)\n\n"
            "CONCERN:\n"
            "Both Dr. Wells (Ophthalmology) and I have recommended evaluation for Sjogren's "
            "syndrome. The patient tells me she was seen in March 2021 and told this was "
            "perimenopause. With respect, the severity of her presentation -- progressive "
            "destruction of dentition in a patient with excellent hygiene, bilateral parotid "
            "enlargement, and concurrent severe dry eye disease -- is NOT consistent with "
            "perimenopausal dryness alone.\n\n"
            "I strongly recommend ANA and anti-SSA/Ro testing at minimum. If positive, "
            "rheumatology referral for formal diagnosis and systemic treatment.\n\n"
            "I will continue to manage her dental care on a 3-month cycle."
