   - **2023-10:** Renal biopsy -- Class IV lupus nephritis (procedure)
4. **Highlight the diagnostic delay** -- 14 months from first symptom to correct diagnosis
5. **Show event classification** -- each event is classified by type (symptom onset, diagnosis, misdiagnosis, lab result, imaging, biopsy, referral, ER visit, treatment start, treatment change, flare)
6. **Show the specialists seen** -- primary care, dermatology, rheumatology, nephrology
7. Point out the pattern: initial dismissal -> delayed testing -> specialist referral -> diagnosis

**Expected output highlights:**
- Chronological timeline with color-coded event types
- Days-from-first-symptom calculation for each event
- Total diagnostic delay prominently displayed

**Key talking point:** *"The diagnostic odyssey analyzer reveals the full timeline of Sarah's journey -- 14 months from first symptoms to diagnosis, 4 different specialists, multiple dismissals. The average lupus patient sees 4 physicians over 4 years before diagnosis. This tool makes that delay visible and actionable."*

### Tab 5: Autoantibody Panel

**Setup:** Navigate to Tab 5 (Autoantibody Panel).

   - Modified Rodnan skin score for skin progression
   - Echocardiography for pulmonary hypertension screening

**Key talking point:** *"Karen's dcSSc with ILD requires therapy that addresses both skin and lung disease. The advisor ranks treatments by evidence level and includes organ-specific monitoring protocols."*

## Patient 9: Michael Torres -- Graves' Disease

### Key Narrative

> A 41-year-old male with Graves' Disease. Positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), elevated free T4, suppressed TSH. HLA-DRB1*03:01 carrier.

### Tab 2: Patient Analysis (Michael Torres)

**Setup:** Navigate to Tab 2 (Patient Analysis).

**Demo steps:**

1. Select **Michael Torres** from the patient dropdown
2. Click **Run Full Analysis**
3. **Show Burch-Wartofsky scoring:**
   - Point system for thyroid storm assessment
   - Components: temperature, CNS effects, GI dysfunction, heart rate, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, precipitant history
   - Score interpretation: < 25 unlikely, 25-44 impending, >= 45 thyroid storm
4. **Show therapy recommendations:**
   - Antithyroid drugs (methimazole, PTU) vs radioactive iodine (RAI) vs thyroidectomy
   - PGx considerations for drug metabolism

**Key talking point:** *"Michael's Graves' Disease case demonstrates the Burch-Wartofsky scoring system for thyroid storm assessment -- a clinical emergency. The agent calculates the score and provides treatment recommendations including the antithyroid drug vs RAI decision framework."*

## Tab 10: Knowledge Base

**Setup:** Navigate to Tab 10 (Knowledge Base).

**Demo steps (use with any patient or standalone):**

1. **Show knowledge base version and statistics:**
   - Version: 2.0.0
   - 22 HLA alleles mapped with disease associations and odds ratios
   - 24 autoantibodies characterized with sensitivity/specificity data
   - 22 biologic therapies catalogued with PGx considerations
   - 20 disease activity scoring systems across 13 diseases
   - 13 flare prediction biomarker patterns
   - 10 ACR/EULAR classification criteria sets
   - 9 overlap syndrome patterns
2. **Show collection statistics:**
   - Vector counts per collection
   - Total vectors across all 14 collections
   - Index type and similarity metric
3. **Show source citations:**
   - ACR/EULAR classification criteria (with publication years)
   - CPIC pharmacogenomic guidelines
   - HLA disease association databases
   - FDA biologic drug approvals

**Key talking point:** *"The knowledge base is curated from validated clinical sources -- ACR/EULAR classification criteria, HLA disease association databases, CPIC pharmacogenomic guidelines, and FDA biologic approvals. Every recommendation traces back to published evidence."*

## Sample API Interactions

For technical audiences, demonstrate the REST API alongside the UI:

### Query via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8532/v1/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What biologics are recommended for refractory lupus nephritis?",
    "patient_id": "sarah_mitchell"
  }'
```

**Expected response:** JSON with `answer`, `evidence` (list of citations with scores), and `knowledge_used` fields.

### Patient Analysis via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8532/v1/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "patient_id": "sarah_mitchell",
    "include_autoantibodies": true,
    "include_hla": true,
    "include_activity": true,
    "include_flare": true,
    "include_therapy": true
  }'
```

**Expected response:** JSON with sections for autoantibody_interpretation, hla_associations, disease_activity, flare_prediction, and therapy_recommendations.

### Export via API

```bash
# FHIR R4 export
curl -X POST http://localhost:8532/v1/export/fhir \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"patient_id": "sarah_mitchell"}' \
  -o sarah_mitchell_fhir.json

# PDF report
curl -X GET http://localhost:8532/v1/report/sarah_mitchell/pdf \
  -o sarah_mitchell_report.pdf
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Streamlit not starting | Port 8531 not responding | Check port is free: `lsof -i :8531`. Kill conflicting process if needed. |
| "No collections found" | Empty results in all tabs | Run `python3 scripts/setup_collections.py --seed` to create and seed collections. |
| RAG returns empty responses | Query returns but with no citations | Check Milvus is running: `curl localhost:19530/healthz`. Verify collections are seeded. |
| Document ingest fails | Error on PDF upload | Check PDF file size (< 50 MB) and format. Ensure PyPDF2 can read the file. Corrupted PDFs will fail. |
| No demo patients available | Patient dropdown is empty | Run `python3 scripts/generate_demo_patients.py` to generate and ingest demo data. |
| LLM features unavailable | Queries return without synthesis | Verify `AUTO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is set with a valid key. |
| HLA analysis empty | No HLA associations shown | Ensure the selected patient has HLA profile data loaded. Not all patients have HLA genotyping. |
| Slow query responses | Queries take > 60 seconds | Check network latency to Anthropic API. Verify Milvus is not under memory pressure (`docker stats`). |
| Collection count mismatch | Fewer than 14 collections | Run `python3 scripts/setup_collections.py --seed` with `--drop-existing` flag to recreate all collections. |

### Milvus Connection Issues

```bash
# Check if Milvus container is running
docker ps | grep milvus

# Check Milvus logs for errors
docker logs milvus-standalone --tail 50

# Restart Milvus if needed
docker restart milvus-standalone

# Wait for Milvus to be ready (30-60 seconds)
until curl -s http://localhost:19530/healthz | grep -q OK; do
  echo "Waiting for Milvus..."
  sleep 5
done
echo "Milvus is ready"
```

### Anthropic API Issues

```bash
# Verify API key is set
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | head -c 10
# Should show: sk-ant-api

# Test API connectivity
curl -s https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Performance Optimization

If demo performance is slow:

1. **Reduce collections searched:** Set `AUTO_TOP_K_PER_COLLECTION=3` (default 5)
2. **Lower evidence threshold:** Set `AUTO_SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.50` (default 0.40) to reduce low-relevance results
3. **Check Docker resource allocation:** Ensure Docker has at least 8 GB RAM allocated
4. **Monitor Milvus memory:** `docker stats milvus-standalone` -- Milvus should use < 4 GB for 14 collections

## Quick Reset

If you need to reset the demo environment completely:

```bash
cd ai_agent_adds/precision_autoimmune_agent

# Re-create collections and re-seed knowledge (drops and recreates)
python3 scripts/setup_collections.py --seed --drop-existing

# Re-generate demo patient data
python3 scripts/generate_demo_patients.py

# Verify all tests pass
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
# -> 455 tests passed

# Restart Streamlit UI
# Ctrl+C the streamlit process, then:
streamlit run app/autoimmune_ui.py --server.port 8531

# Restart FastAPI server
# Ctrl+C the uvicorn process, then:
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8532 --workers 2
```

### Docker Reset

```bash
# Stop all autoimmune agent containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# Watch setup progress
docker compose logs -f autoimmune-setup

# Verify services are healthy
docker compose ps
```
